# Detecting Pneumonia using Convolutional Neural Network

---

## Description
Pneumonia is a severe lung infection that inflames and fills the air sacs in the lungs with fluid or puss. It's a common illness that affects many people each year in the US and around the world. To diagonose this disease, Radiologists looks for the presence and the severity of infiltrate on patient's chest X-Ray image. However, studies have shown that even experienced radiologists often have a hard time correctly identify whether something is an infiltrate on the X-ray. This causes delays in diagnosis, which increases the disease severity and associated mortality rate.
